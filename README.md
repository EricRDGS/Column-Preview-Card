## Overview

the challenge was simple and good for learning how to better use the grid, which was the main focus of the challenge.

## My process

First I created the html structure with main, then the section and the divs to be the cards, then I inserted the h2 tag, p and the images. After that I created a css reset, to remove margin and padding. I also created or css variables, where I put the colors I would use. Then I created the style, where I styled the html content and finally created the responsive css.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

In this challenge I was able to learn and improve a little that I know about display grid, mainly in the part of the grid template collumn property, where I used the repeat function with auto-fit and minmax.

### Continued development

I want to keep learning and improving flexbox, also the grid and also make correct decisions when adding tags and css properties.
